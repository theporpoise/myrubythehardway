#Curebit Walk Through

#Ok, I had a thought on this file for why I shouldn't do it - I have too much else to do!

# This is a great project for someone who doesn't have a project.  But I have plenty of 
# projects to do.  B/c I have plenty of projects to do, motivation is not the problem.
# 	I do not need a project to motivate me. Therefore, I'm just focused on learning.
#If I want a project to do, I'll do it for real, for work... lol...
